# Spring-Boot-REST-API--Sticky-Notes

This is a Spring Boot Tutorial for the beginners who already have some basic knowledge of Spring Core. We will develop a REST API named Sticky Notes. Sticky Notes is an application where people can make profile and create short notes for them as reminders or a to do list. They can create new notes, see their notes, update the existing notes and delete their notes. We will start from scratch in this project and learning spring boot, REST API development and Spring Data.
